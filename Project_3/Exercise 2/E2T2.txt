Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
- TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance
- IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources
- VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic which violates the AWS recommendation
- Server-side encryption is not enabled for S3 buckets
- Loadbalancer does not redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
- The use of a non-root account is not enforced

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance.
- Config the Security Groups only allow 80 and 443 as well as reference the other security group for accessing AWS resource within VPC.
- Set IAM policies for not allowing root user as well as the specific permissions.
- Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
- Enable S3 server-side encryption
