Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The WebAppSG and Web Service Instance are currently placed in a Public Subnet. 
The WebAppSG does not limit inbound and outbound IP addresses, allowing requests from the internet to directly reach the Web Service Instance without going through the ALB, 
leading to potential external attacks.

# Poor practice 2
The S3 buckets do not adhere to the principle of least privilege: do not place the S3 bucket within a specific VPC to restrict public IP access to S3, 
do not configure bucket policies to limit resources and actions (read, write, list, ...) for the buckets.
